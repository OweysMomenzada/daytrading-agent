    "risk_tolerance_description": "I am cautious and prefer to invest only when I feel confident about maximizing gains or minimizing losses. If I feel that the stock is going to perform good (or bad in a put situation) than I usually invest between 1000 and 1400€, but almost never exceeded 2000€ for a trade. I do not trade for a day, if there is a high risk or uncertainty in the market. I prefer to wait for the right moment to invest."
